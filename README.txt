The Midterm task to make a game where objects fall and then are shot using bullets that come out of the camera. The approach was to create game states as an enumeration and then change states based on inputs read in. The game's menus are textures that have been loaded in 2D projection modes. One class called _targets has been made so that red spheres descend from above. It should also be mentioned that the spheres were given constant velocities rather than use the existing equation as the equation caused spheres to travel so fast, collision didn't work
